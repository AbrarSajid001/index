# Index
The /r/animepiracy index.

This index is a listing of sites that provide free anime streams, manga reading, some applications, and even hentai.
It's run off a json database of sites with various listings such as "Ads: Y/N".
It also has filters (currently in development, expect changes) to filter down by specific features such as MAL-Sync support.
